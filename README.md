### Why JUnit test?

* It finds bugs early in the code, which makes our code more reliable.
* JUnit is useful for developers, who work in a test-driven environment.
* Unit testing forces a developer to read code more than writing.
* You develop more readable, reliable and bug-free code which builds confidence during development.
